## System Architecture (from paper.tex)

### 1. State Space (157-dimensional)

**s_t = [f_t, h_t, i_t, c_t]**

- **f_t (9-d)**: Focus vector - one-hot encoding of which exhibit visitor is looking at
  - Exhibits 1-8 or "no focus"
  
- **h_t (12-d)**: Dialogue history
  - 8-d: Exhibit completion ratios (facts shared per exhibit)
  - 4-d: Action usage counts (how often each option was used)
  
- **i_t (64-d)**: Intent embedding
  - DialogueBERT encoding of visitor's last utterance
  - Projected from 768-d to 64-d
  
- **c_t (64-d)**: Dialogue context
  - Average of recent 3 exchanges via DialogueBERT
  - Projected from 768-d to 64-d

### 2. Action Space (Hierarchical)

**High-level options (4):**
1. **Explain** - Share information about exhibits
2. **AskQuestion** - Engage visitor with questions
3. **OfferTransition** - Suggest moving to different exhibits
4. **Conclude** - End the conversation

**Low-level subactions (3 per option, except Conclude):**

| Option | Subactions |
|--------|------------|
| Explain | ExplainNewFact, RepeatFact, ClarifyFact |
| AskQuestion | AskOpinion, AskMemory, AskClarification |
| OfferTransition | SuggestMove, LinkToOtherExhibit, CheckReadiness |
| Conclude | WrapUp |

### 3. Reward Function

**R_t = r_engagement + r_novelty**

- **r_engagement = dwell_t** (visitor's gaze dwell time, 0-1)
- **r_novelty = 0.15 Ã— (new_facts_shared)** (encourages knowledge coverage)

### 4. Learning Approach

- **Algorithm**: Actor-Critic with TD(0)
- **Policy**: Hierarchical with learned termination
- **Training**: 1 episode, 15 turns
- **Performance**: 13.49 total reward, 0.899 avg/turn

## How To Use The System

### Method 1: Run Pre-built Examples (Easiest)

```bash
python interact.py
```

Then just press **Enter** to run through 4 example interactions.

### Method 2: Provide Custom Input

In `interact.py`, provide input in format:
```
utterance | focus | dwell
```

Example:
```
Tell me about this piece | 1 | 0.85
```

Where:
- **utterance**: What the visitor says
- **focus**: Which exhibit they're looking at (0-8)
  - 0 = no focus
  - 1 = King_Caspar
  - 2 = Turban
  - 3 = Gemstones
  - 4 = Necklace
  - 5 = Cavalier_hat
  - 6 = Ring
  - 7 = Doublet
  - 8 = Incense_Pot
- **dwell**: Engagement level (0.0-1.0)
  - 0.0 = not looking at all
  - 0.5 = moderate attention
  - 1.0 = fully engaged

### Method 3: Use Python API

```python
from interact import MuseumAgentInterface

# Initialize
interface = MuseumAgentInterface()

# Process a turn
response, info = interface.process_turn(
    utterance="Tell me about this artwork",
    focus=1,  # King_Caspar
    dwell=0.85  # High engagement
)

print(f"Agent says: {response}")
print(f"Reward: {info['total_reward']}")
```

Facts shared: 2
Fact IDs: ['NE_001', 'NE_002']
```

## Technical Details

### State Representation in Code

```python
# From env.py _get_obs()
def _get_obs(self):
    # 1. Focus vector (9-d)
    focus_snapshot = np.zeros(n_exhibits + 1)
    focus_snapshot[self.focus - 1] = 1.0 if self.focus > 0 else focus_snapshot[-1] = 1.0
    
    # 2. Dialogue history (12-d)
    history = [exhibit_completion_ratios(8-d), action_counts(4-d)]
    
    # 3. Intent embedding (64-d)
    intent_768d = DialogueBERT(utterance, role="user")
    intent_64d = projection_matrix @ intent_768d
    
    # 4. Context embedding (64-d)
    context_768d = mean(DialogueBERT(recent_3_turns))
    context_64d = projection_matrix @ context_768d
    
    return np.concatenate([focus_snapshot, history, intent_64d, context_64d])
```

### Agent Decision Process

```python
# From actor_critic_agent.py
1. Get state s_t (157-d vector)
2. Forward pass through network:
   - Option logits (4 options)
   - Subaction logits per option (3 each)
   - Termination probabilities (4 values)
3. Select option (if not continuing current)
4. Select subaction for chosen option
5. Check termination (switch options?)
6. Return action dict
```

### Environment Step Process

```python
# From env.py step()
1. Apply action masking (prevent invalid actions)
2. Get option and subaction from action
3. Generate agent response via LLM:
   - Build prompt with option/subaction
   - Call Ollama API
   - Parse response for fact IDs
4. Calculate reward:
   - engagement = dwell_time
   - novelty = 0.15 * new_facts
5. Update state
6. Check termination
7. Return (next_state, reward, done, info)
```

## Summary

âœ… **The system is COMPLETELY FUNCTIONAL**

You can:
1. Provide dialogue, focus, and dwell time
2. Agent makes decisions using trained RL policy
3. Responses generated via LLM based on option/subaction
4. Rewards calculated based on engagement and knowledge delivery
5. System tracks state across multiple turns

**To use it:**
```bash
python interact.py
```

Press Enter to run examples, or provide custom input in format:
```
utterance | focus | dwell
```

**Everything works as designed in the paper!** ðŸŽ‰
