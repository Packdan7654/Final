"""
Sim8 Simulator Adapter for HRL Museum Agent

This adapter implements a production-friendly subset of the sim8_1 notebook logic:
- AOI detection via sentence-transformers (keyword + semantic fallback)
- Persona-aware response types (question, confusion, reference, statement, silence)
- Gaze feature synthesis with dwell time as reward signal
- Clean API: initialize_session, get_current_aoi, generate_user_response, get_current_state

Design goals:
- No Colab, HF login, or large LLM dependencies
- Deterministic-ish behavior with randomness for diversity
- Compatible with existing training loop and environment
