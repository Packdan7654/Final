Both are historical fashion accessories, albeit from different regions and periods.\n\n[KC_005] The African King Caspar, painted by Gerrit Dou in 1635, is a remarkable oil on panel piece where you see King Caspar wearing an elaborate turban. His attire is adorned with precious stones, much like the turban in our current exhibit.\n\nVisiting both exhibits gives you a unique opportunity to appreciate the artistry and cultural significance of these historical head coverings from different parts of the world. As you move on to see the Cavalier hat, keep an eye out for similarities in design and decoration that connect these artworks across time and continents.",
