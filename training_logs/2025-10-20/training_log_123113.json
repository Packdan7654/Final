It's titled \"The Dance of Shadows,\" a captivating installation by the renowned artist, Luca Lum.\n\n\"The Dance of Shadows\" was created in 2018 and consists primarily of intricate shadows cast upon the walls, evoking a sense of mystery and wonder. The exhibit explores themes of identity, transformation, and cultural hybridity, all through the beautiful interplay of light and darkness.\n\nLuca Lum uses traditional Chinese lanterns as her primary medium, but instead of filling them with light, she leaves them empty. This creates a unique play of shadows that change as you move around the room. What do you think about the effect it has on the space? Would you like to explore it further together?",
